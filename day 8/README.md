My submission for the task on Day 8.
In the index.js file I have used the following ES6 features.

- I used the import statement to import the `axios` library.
- I used arrow functions to manipulate the data with input params and returning results.
- In the `fetchUsers` function, I used async/await to asynchronously handle the fetching of data using axios.
- In the `filterUsers` function I used destructuring to get the ID, NAME and EMAIL fields alone.
- In the `addUser` function I used Spread operator to add a new user to the existing users.
- In the `removeDuplicates` function I used the Set method to cast my array to a set to remove duplicates.
- Finally I am using a chained function call in a console log to log the output.
